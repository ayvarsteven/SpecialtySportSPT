                <h3 class="services-h3">Orthodontic (Braces)</h3>
                <p>We provide professional orthodontic treatment for patients of all ages. Our goal is to create beautiful smiles and properly functioning bites using state-of-the-art technology. We concentrate not only on the alignment and esthetics of the teeth and smile, but also on how the upper and lower teeth relate to each other in the bite.

                Orthodontic Treatment for All Ages

                Early Treatment: Interceptive treatment to guide the growth of the teeth and jaws to their optimum position. The primary goal of early orthodontic treatment is to head off developing problems that would be difficult to treat in the adolescent years.

                Adolescent Treatment: Conventional treatment in the pre-teen to early teen years, when all of the permanent teeth are present.

                Adult Treatment: Treatment when the jaws have stopped growing. Adults often have orthodontic concerns such as crowding, missing teeth, drifting teeth, long-term problems with the bite or esthetics. Adult teeth move just like adolescent teethâ€”you're never too old for braces!

                <h3 class="services-h3">Dentures</h3>
                <p>When too many teeth are missing to be restored by bridgework, dentures offer a good solution.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="services-h3">Periodontal Therapy</h3>
                <p>The leading cause of tooth loss in adults today is periodontal, or gum, disease. Early diagnosis and treatment for this condition is critical for maintaining healthy teeth and gums.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="services-h3">Bleaching</h3>
                <p>Dentist supervised bleaching is the safest and most effective method to brighten your smile. Two systems are offered for your convenience: an in-office procedure and a take-home delivery system.</p>

                <h3 class="services-h3">Bridges</h3>
                <p>When single or multiple teeth are missing, they can be replaced with either fixed or removable bridges.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="services-h3">Examination</h3>
                <p>The examination is a complete visual inspection of the oral cavity along with any necessary x-rays. Screening for oral cancer and periodontal disease is part of the exam.Cleaning (oral prophylaxis)Cleaning is a preventative procedure that is important to have done at least every 6 months, more often for certain individuals.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="services-h3">Root Canal Therapy</h3>
                <p>When the pulp that is inside the tooth becomes infected, it cannot repair itself. Years ago, extraction was the only option. Today, through endodontics, or root canal therapy, these teeth can be saved.</p>
                <br>    

                <h3 class="services-h3">Fillings</h3>
                <p>Minor cavities can be restored with either silver or white (tooth-colored) fillings. This type of treatment is a good way of correcting a small problem before it becomes a bigger and more expensive problem.</p>
                <br>    

                <h3 class="services-h3">Extractions</h3>
                <p>Extractions are performed when teeth cannot be saved or when they need to be removed for other reasons, such as orthodontics (braces).</p>
                <br>    

                <h3 class="services-h3">Crowns</h3>
                <p>When too much of a tooth is decayed or broken away, it is best restored with a crown. A crown is typically fabricated with porcelain (a tooth-colored material) or gold.</p>
