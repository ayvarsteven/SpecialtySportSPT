            Dr. Santos is the best for root canalsI have seen (he is my third). He enjoys answering all my questions and is good at explaining the procedures he uses. He did an excellent job with my root canal, all the time paying attention to my comfort as well. He is kind, caring, and has a gentle humor, all of which helped me be confident that I had made a great choice when I called the office. I started telling other people about Dr. Santos and was pleased to find that many knew of him and said they admired him personally and professionally. - William G.
